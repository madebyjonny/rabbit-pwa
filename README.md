# Attempt at creating a PWA version of the Rabbit device

scrappy code atm just to sketch out the functionaly right now to see what is feasiable.
Trying to do it with mostly vanilla JS + astro.

you will need an open ai api key to make this work. but you should be about to just 

```
npm/bun install 

bun/npm run dev

```
